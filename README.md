Virtual Reality for Surgical Guidance
In orthopaedic surgeries, soft tissue tumor resection is a challenging task,
especially by defining the optimal resection margin.The main challange is due to the movements of the tumor in the soft tissue, 
the perception of the  surgeon is not optimal and this can lead to either touching the tumor or cutting
the healthy tissue.
-Aim in the surgery is to cut the tumor
 tissue with 1 2 cm biased circle around
 it without touching the tumor
So in general, Aim of this project is to design and develop a multimodal feedback system
for guiding surgeons during soft tissue tumor resection task in orthopaedic
surgery.

For this purpose I implemented 3 different sonification system which could be suitable for guidance according to surgeon's choice.

In the first one------------------------------
As you get closer to the tumor the sound that you hear is similar like a sound that you hear from the park sensor.

Second one------------------------
The sounds were based on nature. As you get closer from one layer to other you can hear the transition which means by just focusing
to the sounds in each layer you can get a feeling of when you are getting far away from every layer. The pitch of sound is changing and low pass filter 
is applied according to transition.

Third one------------------------
In every layer there are different sounds but this time there is no transition effect. If you are in the last layer which has distance to the tumor
for2-3 cm, in that area the sound is same.
